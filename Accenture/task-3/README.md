Hello,

Due some personal issues (broken collarbone), I could not write a complete documentation.

I hope the informations you'll find out here cover most part of your questions.

## Project design
This [document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13PmIrLTR66IFLxVGpvNSOFFrLpv6-fq9/view?usp=sharing) provides an idea about how an app should be designed.

At the last topic you can find how to structure API routes, following REST approach concepts.

## Frontend
You can read my post about my react boilerplate clicking [here](https://dev.to/cl4pper/created-my-own-react-boilerplate-i31).

After reached a good structure, I was feeling myself confident to share it with others developers and get some feedback.

## Backend
[Here](https://github.com/cl4pper/api-boilerplate) is my node api boilerplate.

It's in an initial phase, but I've already used it in some personal projects.

Still working only with MongoDB, but keen to add PostgreSQL as an option for the future versions.

## Extras
